# 2. Structure 
* The Data folder stores 2 files, input.csv and processedInput.csv
* input.csv is the original dataset file obtained from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/360/air+quality).
* processedInput.csv is the processed dataset once data processesing is performed in this project.
<br></br>
* The Visualziations folder stores 2 main types of files.
* Visualuizations.twb is the tableau workbook that builds all of the visualizations for this project.
* The rest of the files (which started with a number) are the visualization generated from Visualuizations.twb
<br></br>
* Codebase.R is the R codebase where all of the project's task (exploratory data analysis, statistical analysis and inferences) are executed here.

* Readme.md is the file you are reading now :)
